How to run the program
========================
The program is a generic merge sort for INTEGERS
```
./generic_merge_sort INSERT ARRAY HERE

Example:
./generic_merge_sort 4 5 2 6 3 7 2 10
Output: 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 10
```

Lab - Generic Merge Sort
========================
On this lab you will be creating a [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) based program for sorting either strings or integers.

As a guide, take a look in the Quick Sort example from the [C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) book
on **Section 5.11 - Pointers to Functions**.

General instructions
--------------------

2. Submit your code to your personal fork.
3. Use the  `generic_merge_sort.c` file for your code.
4. Have fun and don't forget the next section.
